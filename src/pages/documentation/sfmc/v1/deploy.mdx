# $ deploy

Once you have a downloaded `.package.manifest.json` file and any initial updates have been made, you can run the `bldr deploy` command.

The deploy command will perform the following actions (updating the manifest file as needed):
- Create a `.local.manifest.json` file
- Gather all folder paths and create them in SFMC
- Split packaged assets into zero-dependency assets and dependency assets
- Create all zero-dependency assets
- Create dependency assets


```
$ bldr deploy
