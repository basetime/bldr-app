# $ Push

The Push command allows you to take the files that have been added to the stash and create or update them in your targeted SFMC isntance. Once files have been created or updated in SFMC, the contents of the file will be updated in the `.local.manifest.json` file for that entry.

```
  $ bldr push

## Creating New Folders

During the push commands processing, any files that do not currently exist in SFMC will have some additional steps taken prior to being created in SFMC. 

BLDR will look through the file path of the asset and look for a folder in the `.local.manifest.json` file. If a folder is not found it will be created accordingly in SFMC for that context.

Once created, it will be added to the `.local.manifest.json` file.
