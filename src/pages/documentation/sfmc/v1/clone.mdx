# $ clone

Cloning for folders and assets requires the use of a context flag along with the ID of the folder/asset you are cloning.

| flags          | description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| --cb -f        | Content Builder Folder ID to Clone          |
| --cb -a        | Content Builder Asset ID to Clone           |
| --cb -f:shared | Shared Content Builder Folder ID to Clone   |
| --cb -a:shared | Shared Content Builder Asset ID to Clone    |
| --as -f        | Automation Folder ID to Clone               |
| --as -a        | Automation Object ID to Clone               |
| --as -f:sql    | SQL Activity Folders                        |
| --as -a:sql    | SQL Activity Assets                         |
| --as -f:ssjs   | SSJS Activity Folders                       |
| --as -a:ssjs   | SSJS Activity Assets                        |
| --de -f        | Data Extension Folder Id to Clone           |
| --de -a        | Data Extension Customer Key to Clone        |
| --de -f:shared | Shared Data Extension Folder Id to Clone    |
| --de -a:shared | Shared Data Extension Customer Key to Clone |

## Cloning Folders

When cloning from a folder ID, BLDR will identify all nested sub-folders under the root ID. All folders and their assets will be gathered and created locally and added to the `.local.manifest.json` file.

```
$ bldr clone --cb -f 93839
Starting Clone
created [local]: Welcome Email 1
created [local]: Welcome Email 2
created [local]: welcome_hero_module_1
created [local]: coupon_module_1
created [local]: coupon_module_2
created [local]: Promotional Offer
created [local]: Winback Email 1
```

### Folder and File Output

```
.
|-- Welcome Program Assets (git repository)
|---- Content Builder
|   |---- Welcome Emails
|   |   |---- welcome_v1
|   |   |   |---- Welcome Email 1.html
|   |   |   |---- Promotional Offer.html
|   |   |   |---- coupon_module_1.html
|   |   |---- welcome_v2
|   |   |   |---- Welcome Email 2.html
|   |   |   |---- Winback Email 2.html
|   |   |   |---- coupon_module_2.html
|   |   |   |---- welcome_hero_module_1.html
|---- .local.manifest.json
```

## Cloning Automation Assets

When cloning a specific asset, for example an automation, BLDR will start with the automation itself and work its way through all activities within it. In the example below, the automation `Welcome Automation Process` has: two SQL Queries, a Data Extension Extract, and an Email Send.

When cloning an automation that has Email Sends, BLDR will pull both the user-initiated shell as well as the Content Builder email itself.

```
$ bldr clone --as -a 7e626e82-0831-4ade-9b24-2d2a6c8a7deb

created: Welcome Automation Process
created: init_welcome_audience
created: welcome_suppression_purchase
created: extract_analytics_data_extension
created: Welcome Email 1.html
```

### Folder and File Output

```
.
|-- Welcome Program Processing (git repository)
|---- Automation Studio
|   |---- my automations
|   |   |---- Welcome Automation Process.json
|   |---- Query
|   |   |---- init_welcome_audience.sql

|   |---- Extracts

|   |   |   |---- Welcome Email 1.html
|---- .local.manifest.json
```

## Asset Support

All files that are fully supported will be created as either a `.html`, `.sql`, or `.js` file. Files that are partially supported will be created as a `.json` file.

## Shared Content

Shared Content Builder Assets and Shared Data Extensions can only be accessed while targeting the **Parent Level BU**.
