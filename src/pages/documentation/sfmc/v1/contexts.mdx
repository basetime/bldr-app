# Contexts

BLDR defines SFMC Contexts as the _builders/studios_ and _objects/assets_ within SFMC. The processing and BLDR support may vary based on each specific context. In regard to BLDR commands, _search_ and _clone_ require a context flag to be used.

<br />

## Context Flags

|Context               | Flag                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Content Builder      | --cb, --content-builder   |
| Automation Studio    | --as, --automation-studio |
| Data Extension       | --de, --data-extension    |

<br />

## Content Builder Support

All assets within Content Builder are defined by their `assetType` and are identified by their `assetId`; because of this there are no sub-context distinctions made for asset types.

### Fully Supported Assets

Fully supported assets are asset types that when cloned from SFMC are created as fully editable `.html` files.

- html emails
- code snippet content blocks
- html content blocks

<br />

### Partially Supported Assets

Partially supported assets are asset types that when cloned from SFMC are created as `.json` files. These files can still be updated/edited directly in the JSON structure and updated within SFMC. 

Asset types that are partially supported are any not listed in the _Fully Supported Assets_ section above.

<br />

### CloudPages and Code Resource Pages

Support for CloudPages and Code Resource Pages falls somewhere in-between _fully supported_ and _partially supported_.

These asset types will not show up or be cloned down when running the clone command for a folder Id -- these assets are stored under the root _Content Builder_ folder. To access and clone CloudPages and Code Resource Pages, run `bldr search --cb {cloudpage/resource name}`. As long as the asset exists it will be displayed, then run `bldr clone --cb -a <assetId>`.

Once cloned, they will be created in the root `Content Builder` folder in your local directory.

Updating these assets in SFMC will be successful up until the point of `publish`. There is currently no API support for publishing CloudPages or Code Resource pages via API, however the code in the resource will be updated.

<br />

## Automation Studio

Assets within Automation Studio are separated out into sub-contexts based on activity type. Currently, the following sub-contexts are available based on BLDRs support for activities.

| Sub-Context        | Flag     |
| -------------------| ---------|
| SQL Query          | :sql     |
| Script Activity    | :ssjs    |

Sub-context flags can be used directly following the `-f` and `-a` flags.
`bldr search --as -a:sql <query name>` <br/>
`bldr clone --as -f:ssjs <ssjs folder id>`


<br />

### Fully Supported Assets

Fully supported assets are asset types that when cloned from SFMC are created as fully editable `.html/.sql` files.

-   query activities
-   script activities

<br />

### Partially Supported Assets

Partially supported assets are asset types that when cloned from SFMC are created as `.json` files. These files can still be updated/edited directly in the JSON structure and updated within SFMC. Asset types that are partially supported are any not listed in the **Fully Supported Assets** section above.
