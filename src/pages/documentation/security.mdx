## Setting up BLDR CLI

The BLDR CLI is designed so you can use it across as many SFMC instances as you require. The interactions with SFMC are completed using a Server-to-Server API Package set up within each SFMC Instance. 

In team secnarios, it's recommended that a shared Installed Package be created for the CLI that can be used between all team members.

<br />

### SFMC Installed Package

1. Navigate to `Settings > Setup > Platform Tools > Apps > Installed Packages`
2. Click on `New` to create a new Package and name it `bldr-cli`
3. Click on `Add Component` to add a new API Component and select `API Integration` and then `Server-to-Server`
4. Navigate to `Access` and ensure that the Installed Package is provisioned for all Business Units that you may need access to.
5. Update the scope of the Installed Package to match the permissions below
