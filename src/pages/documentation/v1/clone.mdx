# $ clone

Cloning for folders and assets requires the use of a context flag along with the name of the folder/asset you are cloaning. 

## Cloning Folders
When cloning from a folder ID, BLDR will identify all nested subfolders under the root ID. All folders and their assets will be gathered and created locally.

```
$ bldr clone --cb -f 93839
created: Welcome Email 1
created: Welcome Email 2
created: welcome_hero_module_1
created: coupon_module_1
created: coupon_module_2
created: Promotional Offer
created: Winback Email 1 
```

### Folder and File Output

```
.
|-- Welcome Program Assets (git repository)
|---- Content Builder
|   |---- Welcome Emails 
|   |   |---- welcome_v1
|   |   |   |---- Welcome Email 1.html
|   |   |   |---- Promotional Offer.html
|   |   |   |---- coupon_module_1.html
|   |   |---- welcome_v2
|   |   |   |---- Welcome Email 2.html
|   |   |   |---- Winback Email 2.html
|   |   |   |---- coupon_module_2.html
|   |   |   |---- welcome_hero_module_1.html
|---- .bldr
|---- .local.manifest.json
```
<br />

## Cloning Assets

When cloning a specific asset, for example an automation, BLDR will start with the automation itself and work its way through all activities within it. In the example below, the automation `Welcome Automation Process` has: two SQL Queries, a Data Extension Extract, and an Email Send.

When cloning an automation that has Email Sends, BLDR will pull both the user-initiated shell as well as the Content Builder email itself.

```
$ bldr clone --as -a 7e626e82-0831-4ade-9b24-2d2a6c8a7deb

created: Welcome Automation Process
created: init_welcome_audience
created: welcome_suppression_purchase
created: extract_analytics_data_extension
created: Welcome Email 1.html

```

### Folder and File Output

```
.
|-- Welcome Program Processing (git repository)
|---- Automation Studio
|   |---- my automations 
|   |   |---- Welcome Automation Process.json
|   |---- Query 
|   |   |---- init_welcome_audience.sql
|   |   |---- welcome_suppression_purchase.sql
