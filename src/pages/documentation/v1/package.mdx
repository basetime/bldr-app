Aside from being a development tool, BLDR provides a way for you to migrate or share your code among your team or within the SFMC community. 

With the `bldr package` command, bldr will take the following actions:
1. Slim down your `.local.manifest.json` file by removing the asset details that are not needed to create your assets elsewhere
2. If you have a `.sfmc.config.json` file, bldr will run the process to update your configuration keys
3. Scan all files to locate dependencies within HTML, AMPscript, and SSJS
4. Grab all dependencies as needed and replace their spot in your file with the generated bldrIds
5. Creates your `.package.manifest.json` file
