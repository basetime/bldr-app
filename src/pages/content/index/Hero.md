BLDR is a CLI Application and Package Registry for Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC).

The driving force behind the open-source BLDR project is to bring working with SFMC a bit closer to a true development workflow as well as provide developers and users a way to share/distribute projects with team and community members.']}
